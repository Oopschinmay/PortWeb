                <h2 style="color: #1b263b;">Textlyze</h2>
                <p>A text-manipulation React app allows users to perform various operations on text input. Core features
                    include transforming text by converting to uppercase, lowercase, reversing strings, removing extra
                    spaces, and counting characters or words. The app typically has a simple UI, where users input or
                    paste text into a form field and select the desired operation via buttons or dropdowns. Instant
                    feedback is provided by displaying the manipulated text in real-time. Built using React, the app
                    leverages state management (with hooks like useState) to handle text input and display results
                    dynamically. </p>

                <p>The News-App is a dynamic, responsive platform that delivers the latest news in real time.

                    technology, sports, and entertainment. Users can explore curated news feeds, view article summaries,
                    and click through to full stories. The app uses state management for seamless navigation, and React
                    hooks for efficient data fetching and rendering. Styled with modern UI frameworks, the app provides
                    a clean, engaging interface that adapts smoothly to both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
